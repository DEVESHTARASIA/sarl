SARL is a general-purpose agent-oriented language, http://www.sarl.io.

SARL aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic reconfiguration. 
These high-level features are now considered as the major requirements for an easy and practical implementation of modern complex software applications. 
We are convinced that the agent-oriented paradigm holds the keys to effectively meet this challenge.

Considering the variety of existing approaches and meta-models in the field of agent-oriented engineering and more generally multi-agent systems, our approach remains as generic as possible and highly extensible to easily integrate new concepts and features. The language is platform- and architecture-independent. 

However, we provide a first set of tools to support its execution based on the new version 2.0 of the Janus (see http://www.janusproject.io) platform, but it can be linked with other existing agent platforms and frameworks.

toc::[]

== 1. Requirements

* Java Development Toolkit (JDK) 1.8 or higher.

== 2. Using SARL

=== 2.1. Recommendations

For making your experience with SARL the best, we recommend you:

* *to enable the assertions at development time (with the `-ea` command line option).*

=== 2.2. Use the stable version with Maven

The lastest stable version of SARL is available on link:http://search.maven.org/[Maven Central].
Consequently, you could directly include the SARL module into the Maven dependencies of your project:

```xml
	...
	<dependency>
	  <groupId>io.sarl.maven</groupId>
	  <artifactId>io.sarl.maven.sdk</artifactId>
	  <version>0.4.2</version>
	</dependency>
	...
```

Please, replace Version `0.4.2` in the previous snipset by the number of the version you want to use.

=== 2.3. Use of the development version with Maven

New features, enhancements and bug fixes are available in the SNAPSHOT (development) version of SARL.
For using this version, you must add the Maven Repository Server of SARL in your pom file:

```xml
	...
	<dependencies>
	  <dependency>
	    <groupId>io.sarl.maven</groupId>
	    <artifactId>io.sarl.maven.sdk</artifactId>
	    <version>0.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	  </dependency>
	<dependencies>
	...
	<repositories>
	  <repository>
	    <id>io.sarl-maven</id>
	    <name>SARL Snapshots</name>
	    <url>http://maven.sarl.io/</url>
	  </repository>
	</repositories>
	<pluginRepositories>
    	  <pluginRepository>
	    <id>io.sarl-maven</id>
	    <name>SARL Snapshots</name>
	    <url>http://maven.sarl.io/</url>
	    <snapshots>
	      <enabled>true</enabled>
	    </snapshots>
	  </pluginRepository>
	</pluginRepositories>
	...
```

=== 2.4. Compile SARL code with Maven

For compiling SARL source files with Maven, you should use the provided plugin: `sarl-maven-plugin`.
It invokes the SARL and Java compilers with a simpler interface than the standard Xtext maven plugin.
For using the `sarl-maven-plugin`, you should add in your pom file:

```xml
	...
	<build>
	  <plugins>
	    <plugin>
	      <groupId>io.sarl.maven</groupId>
	      <artifactId>sarl-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	      <version>0.4.2</version>
	      <extensions>true</extensions>
	      <configuration>
	        <source>1.8</source>
	        <target>1.8</target>
	        <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
	      </configuration>
	    </plugin>
	    ...
	  </plugins>
	  ...
	</build>
	...
```

Please, replace Version `0.4.2` in the previous snipset by the number of the version you want to use.

CAUTION: Do not forget to set the `extensions` flag to `true`.

=== 2.5. Syntax highlighting with other tools

Several style specifications are provided for syntax highlighting in third party tools.
Style specifications are provided for:
